File-upload-in-Node
===================

trying to upload files and get them displayed
## Usage
``by using multer 
##concerns
``would I be able to dynamically render images by maybe storing(pushing&pooling) image urls from/to the database 
``by makiing a use of handlebars,{{mustaches}} and html tags
``
``
**

##Discovered that when upload image button is pressed uploaded files are saved on my local path
``would I find a way also to link those database values eg **<img url({{url}})> </img>**
